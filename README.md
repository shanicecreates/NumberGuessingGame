# NumberGuessingGame
This game uses a command-line-style interface to guess the correct numbers. The number guessing game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within five attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is greater or less than the actual number. If the player correctly guesses the number within the given attempts, they win; otherwise, the game reveals the correct number.
